# ❤️ Heart Disease Analysis Project

**Summer Bootcamp Training Project**  
**SRMCEM, Lucknow**  


This project is a comprehensive data science analysis focused on understanding patterns and risk factors related to **heart attacks**. Our team explored multiple patient data sources and developed visualizations and reports using **Python**, **SQL**, **Power BI**, and **Jupyter Notebooks**.

---

## 🫀 About the Project

The core objective of the project was to **identify causes, patterns, and contributing factors related to heart attacks**, using real-world clinical datasets. We aimed to derive insights that can aid in early detection, better diagnosis, and healthcare planning.

<details> 
<summary> 🧩 Project Goals</summary>


- Understand patient demographics and medical history
- Identify key diagnostic markers and abnormal lab results
- Explore the relationship between medications and diagnoses
- Analyze visit patterns and hospitalization frequency
- Integrate and visualize data through dashboards

</details>
<details>
  
<summary> 📚 Datasets Used</summary>
  
- `patients.csv` – Patient demographics and IDs
- `visits.csv` – Details of hospital visits and admissions
- `diagnosis.csv` – Medical diagnoses related to cardiovascular conditions
- `lab_record.csv` – Lab test results (e.g., cholesterol, ECG, blood pressure)
- `medication.csv` – Prescribed drugs and treatment histories

</details>
<details> 
<summary> 🔬 Key Analysis Areas</summary>

- Patient-level profiling
- Temporal patterns in visits and treatments
- Correlation between diagnoses and lab findings
- Effectiveness and frequency of specific medications
- Data integration across files for comprehensive case analysis

The project involved SQL-based data extraction, Python-based analysis using libraries such as **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**, as well as the development of a **Power BI dashboard** for executive-level visual insights.
